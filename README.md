# Odoo Connection Tools

Compilation of tools useful to extract data from a live Odoo envoriment.

> Depending on the configuration of the Odoo enviornment multiple restrictions are set in place to hinder the process of manipulating data from the Postgres database backend be it directly by the Odoo development team or by the software implementer third-party. By default Odoo probits the connection directly to the Postgres SQL server instance and restricts the ammount of data that can be extracted from a single SQL query.
